        <p>Welcome to the CougarThunderFalconBirds home page!</p>
        <p>The clan was founded by Darklight as a means for friends to play together within the game of Destiny. The clan continued to grow as many more friends joined the clan. Later this ideal became an unwritten rule, to join you had to know someone.</p>
        <p>"Destiny is a first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie and published by Activision. It was released on September 9, 2014, for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One consoles. Destiny marked Bungie's first new console franchise since the Halo series, and it is the first game in a ten-year agreement between Bungie and Activision. Set in a "mythic science fiction" world, the game features a multiplayer "shared-world" environment with elements of role-playing games."</p>
        <p>"Players take on the role of a Guardian, defenders of Earth's last safe city, as they wield a power called Light to protect the city from different alien races. The Guardians are tasked with reviving a celestial being called the Traveler, while journeying to different planets to investigate and destroy the alien threats before humanity is completely wiped out."
