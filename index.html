                <h2>The Purpose</h2>
                The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our web development skills. So far on this page I've used
                the header, main and footer groups. I created a navigation bar within my headers. I've created links
                with images within the footers. And I also formatted images and added several nested list
                within the body of these pages.
                </p>
                <p>To wrap things up I applied CSS to format the page and to make it look interesting.</p>

            <div id="intro">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I was born in Caguas, Puerto Rico on September 20th, 1981. My family moved to New Jersey when I was 3
                    years old. Most of my family still lives on the island. I speak both English and Spanish fluently.
                    My
                    interests vary widely and my curiosity knows no bounds. I am a great listener by nature and love
                    expressing myself on paper, usually in the form of poems.</p>
                <p>What I bring to my peers is a fountain of knowledge and experiences. After High School, I joined the
                    Navy where I went to school for two years to study Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering. Afterwards I
                    served on a submarine for four years as a mechanic in the engineering department. I did two tours
                    overseas where I traveled most of Europe. I have developed strong problem solving skills, team
                    skills,
                    math skills, communications skills, and even study skills. I have worked several jobs since,
                    including
                    clerk, builder, security supervisor, and scale house operator. None were as impactful or as life
                    changing to me as was the Navy. One very important lesson I learned in the Navy is that there is
                    nothing
                    I can't learn. A lesson I take to heart and will carry forward with me forever.</p>

                        <q>ISTPs love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the world

                            them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity. People with this personality type are
                            natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for
                            the fun of it, and learning from their environment as they go. Often mechanics and
                            engineers,
                            ISTPs find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting
                            them back together, just a little bit better than they were before.</q>

                        <q>Few personality types are as bold and practical as ISTPs. Known for their technical mastery
                            and willingness to improvise, ISTPs are good at finding unique solutions to seemingly
                            impossible challenges. ISTPs' desire to explore and learn new things is invaluable in many
