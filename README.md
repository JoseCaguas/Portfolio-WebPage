# Portfolio-WebPage
Portfolio created for josecaguas.net as part of my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Project.
Concerning the RecBox Project...
  Week of 7/18
    The A2Z system is looking good. There are some behavior items I would like to address later.
    I need to create an XML and fill it with the information from boxes.
    I will then need to create queries for each letter and attach them to the buttons.
    I will create an iframe just below the A2Z buttons and create a blank HTML for the queries to output to.
    I may have to find a command to refresh the iframe after the query outputs.
    I will add CSS to the Query HTML to make the output look nice and organized.
    Possibly add the colorful heart as a background in the iframe.
    To finish off the page I would like to create a search box.
      The I will create a button and add it to the end of the A2Z.
      I will have a nice looking drawer open up to input the search.
      once the search completes the drawer will close and fill & update the query HTML.
      I will have to update the XML with Tags for each entry.
      I will have the search box search the Tags instead of just names.
    I should see about making a sub directory just for the RecBox. It'll be easier that way to get to.
      I'll have to check with both the hosting service provider and domain name provider.
      I'll make a temporary RecBox.josecaguas.net subdirectory.
